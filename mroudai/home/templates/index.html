            Teaching was never a goal for myself. However, after I started in 2010 I found myself liking it more 
            everytime I taught. I taught several students in both class environments and one on one settings. 
            I discovered that I like when my students tell me I made something they thought was difficult very 
            easy. I also discovered that teaching has solidified my foundations and made it possible for me to self
            learn many skills I currently use today. Because of these reasons I have refined my teaching methods to
            show students how to properly link lessons together and how these lessons can be applied to the real world.

            <p class="light">
              Since each student learns differently an evaluation is given to each student before determining how much time they need
              and where they should start from with the sessions. The evaluation helps to identify how students think and assesses the
              the level of knowledge they have. Once sessions start I will keep track of the topics they learn and how many topics are 
              required to be covered. After every five sessions they will be evaluated again to determine their progress. In some cases 
              repeated evaluations will not be needed if there is a noticeable improvement in their grades.

              I offer one on one sessions for forms one up to form five students. I tutor the following subjects:
              <ul>
                <li> Mathematics </li>
                <li> Additional Mathematics </li>
                <li> Physics </li>
                <li> Information Technology </li>
              </ul>
              For form one to form three each session costs $80. For form four and form five students each session costs $100. Each session 
              last one hour.
